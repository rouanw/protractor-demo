# Keeping your functional tests DRY

This repository contains an example of how to structure your functional tests in a way that is easy to read, maintain and extend. It uses Protractor.

Check out these tags to see the progression:

* `git checkout start` - an empty protractor skeleton, with grunt
* `git checkout simpletest` - a test with no abstraction
* `git checkout helper` - extract a helper
* `git checkout pages` - extract a few page objects
* `git checkout steps` - extract a steps object
